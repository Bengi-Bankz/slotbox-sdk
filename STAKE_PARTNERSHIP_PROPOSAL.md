**To:** Business Development Team, Stake.com

Hi [Name],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I'm the founder of **SlotBox SDK** - a revolutionary platform that's transforming how casino games are created and deployed.

### **The Opportunity**

I'm reaching out because I believe we have a unique opportunity to create a **win-win-win partnership** that could significantly expand Stake's game library while reducing development costs and risks.

### **What is SlotBox SDK?**

SlotBox SDK is a cutting-edge game development platform built on **PixiJS 9** that enables developers to create professional-quality slot games with unprecedented ease:

- **Drag & Drop Interface**: No coding required for basic game creation
- **Advanced Features**: AI-powered suggestions, built-in texture packer, FFmpeg integration
- **Professional Quality**: Games that rival those from major studios
- **Rapid Development**: Games can be created in days, not months

### **The Partnership Model**

Instead of traditional licensing fees, I'm proposing a **three-way revenue sharing model**:

1. **Developers** create games using SlotBox SDK (completely free)
2. **SlotBox** provides tools, support, and quality assurance
3. **Stake** hosts and operates the games on your platform
4. **Revenue flows** to all parties only when games are successful

### **Revenue Distribution Proposal:**
- **Developer**: 85-90% of game revenue
- **SlotBox**: 7-10% of game revenue  
- **Stake**: Your standard platform fees (negotiated separately)

### **Benefits for Stake:**

‚úÖ **Zero Upfront Costs**: No developer advances or licensing fees
‚úÖ **Curated Content**: All games pre-tested and quality assured
‚úÖ **Innovation Pipeline**: Access to cutting-edge game mechanics
‚úÖ **Risk Mitigation**: Only pay when games perform well
‚úÖ **Market Differentiation**: Unique games that competitors don't have
‚úÖ **Scalable Content**: Attract more developers to create Stake-exclusive games

### **Current Status:**

- **Beta Platform**: Fully functional SDK in testing
- **Developer Interest**: 15+ developers signed up for beta access
- **Technical Integration**: Ready for API integration with gaming platforms
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in RTP validation and compliance tools

### **Next Steps**

I'd love to schedule a 30-minute call to:
1. Show you a **live demo** of the platform
2. Discuss **technical integration** requirements
3. Explore **partnership terms** that work for both parties
4. Share **revenue projections** based on our developer pipeline

### **Why Now?**

The crypto gaming space is exploding, and content is king. This partnership could position Stake as the platform of choice for innovative game developers while creating a sustainable, profitable ecosystem for everyone involved.

Are you available for a brief call this week? I'm flexible with timing and can work around your schedule.

Best regards,
